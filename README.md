# -Spotify-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Python

**An exploratory data analysis of Spotify's music dataset using Python.**

## Project Overview

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Spotify's music dataset to extract meaningful insights about song characteristics and trends. Utilizing Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, we delve into various aspects of the dataset to understand patterns and relationships within the music data.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Identified and handled null values to ensure data quality.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Computed summary statistics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of key variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Created various plots to visualize distributions, correlations, and trends over time.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed how song attributes have evolved over the years.
- **Genre Analysis**: Explored the characteristics of songs across different genres.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db), which contains detailed information about various tracks available on Spotify.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for writing and running code.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Top 10 Most Popular Songs**: Identified the most popular tracks in the dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between audio features such as loudness, energy, and popularity.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigated how song durations and other attributes have changed over time.
